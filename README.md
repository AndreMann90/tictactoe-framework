tictactoe-framework
===================

An easy to use framework to build on a TicTacToe-Game. When using this framework, you only need to provide a GUI.

**Note:** This framework has been evolved in order to be used in a Tic-Tac-Toe Android app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.manntertainment.smarttictactoe). This repo will be accordingly updated soon. The project structure will be changed to fit the structure of a typical gradle or maven project.
